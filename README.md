# 📈 Performance Analysis and Risk of Fall of a Financial Asset 

## 📝 Project Description
This repository contains a Python script designed to perform a detailed analysis of the performance and risk of a specific financial asset. This project evaluates the historical performance of the investment, providing a clear view of its profitability and potential risk of loss over time.

## 📊 Metrics and Analysis
The script generates a report with the following key visualizations and metrics:

- Cumulative Return: A graph showing how an initial investment of $1 would have grown or decreased over the study period.
Maximum Drawdown: Identifies the largest percentage loss from a peak experienced by the investment, a crucial metric for understanding drawdown risk.
Drawdown Duration: Measures the time, in days, it took the investment to recover from its most significant drop.


## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For managing and manipulating time series data.
- NumPy: For efficient numerical calculations.
- Matplotlib: For creating professional visualizations.


## 🧠 Demonstrated Skills

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Perform quantitative analysis of financial assets.
- Use data science libraries to process and visualize time-series data.
- Interpret risk and return metrics, such as drawdown.
- Communicate complex findings clearly and concisely through graphics.
